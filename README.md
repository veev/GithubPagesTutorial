# GithubPagesTutorial

Github has a good [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) on the various ways to set up github pages on a repository. 
For our purposes, select "Project Site" and "Start From Scratch"

##Things to keep in mind:
1. Github pages needs to be a clean, separate branch, called 'gh-pages'
2. Github pages operates over http, not https, so no credit card numbers, passwords or other sensitive info should be given to the site.

##To load the Github pages site:
1. The naming structure is: http://username.github.io./repo
2. So for this example it would be http://o-c-r.github.io/predict
